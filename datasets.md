# Datasets
You will use two datasets from the Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City to address their problems.

311 complaint dataset

This dataset is available at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9. You can download part of this data by using SODA API.

Download only the data that is related to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Also, restrict your data to the limited number of fields. Otherwise, your data size will be unnecessarily large, and it might not work in the Watson Studio environment. Too much data can also be very slow to process and analyze.

PLUTO dataset for housing

This dataset for housing can be accessed from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Primary-Land-Use-Tax-Lot-Output-PLUTO-/xuk2-nczf. After you download the data, use only the part that is specific to the borough that you are interested in based on your analysis.
