# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Capstone-project
EDX course 

## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this capstone project, you must understand how to use data science techniques such as data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning by using Python.

Before taking this course, you should have already completed following courses:

- [ ] Python Basics for Data Science
- [ ] Analyzing Data with Python
- [ ] Visualizing Data with Python and
- [ ] Machine Learning with Python: A Practical Introduction

You need to use the Python programming language in Jupyter notebooks. You need to run the notebooks by using minimum environment of 4 CPU and 16 GB.

## Learning Objectives

This capstone project will showcase your data science and machine learning skills to solve real business problems.

After the successful completion of this project, you will know how to:

- [ ] Use data science methodologies to address real-world business problems
- [ ] Support business decision based on results from a data science activity


## Welcome to the Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone project!
In this project, you will answer questions about real-life business problems by using data science techniques.

You’ll have to use your knowledge of data science to address the problems and provide solutions. You will also share your answers to these problems with other students.

This course has 6 modules. If you spend 2 - 4 hours per module, and complete 1 module per week, it would take about 6 weeks to complete the course.

You'll use following data science techniques to address the four main business problems identified in this project:

Ingest the course datasets.
Explore the datasets and identify the key problem.
Identify and create features to create machine learning models.
Explore various machine learning algorithms to arrive at the best possible machine learning model.
You need to complete following activities as part of this project:

Create four separate notebooks to answer four business questions as described in the problem statement.
Provide concluding remarks to the four 4 business questions based on the analysis you did in the notebooks
Complete short quizzes for each of the four business questions.
Review one of your peers’ work (4 separate notebooks with answers to the 4 business questions) and grade that person's answers.


Important: Before you download the notebooks, ensure that you remove all your user credentials.

This Capstone Project is organized in six modules. Each module should take about 1 week (2 to 4 hrs) to complete. 

## Module 1

Module 1 (Project Overview and Setup) - In this Module you will get overview of the Problem that you have to solve. The Problem you have to solve are broken into 4 specific questions. Those 4 questions are provided in the Problem Statement section of this module. Also this module has instructions to setup necessary environment before you start the actual work.

## Module 2

2. Module 2 (Problem Set I: Identify Top Complaint Type) - In this Module you will focus on solving the Question 1 provided in Problem Statement section of Module 1. This module also has a Quiz section where there are some additional multiple choice Quiz Questions related to the Question you are addressing in this module.

## Module 3

3. Module 3 (Problem Set II: Identify Areas most affected by Top Complaint Type) - In this Module you will focus on solving the Question 2 provided in Problem Statement section of Module 1. This module also has a Quiz section where there are some additional multiple choice Quiz Questions related to the Question you are addressing in this module.

## Module 4

4. Module 4 (Problem Set III: Identify Relationship between Building Characteristics and Top Complaint Type) - In this Module you will focus on solving the Question 3 provided in Problem Statement section of Module 1. This module also has a Quiz section where there are some additional multiple choice Quiz Questions related to the Question you are addressing in this module.

## Module 5

5. Module 5 (Problem Set IV: Predict Top Complaint Type) - In this Module you will focus on solving the Question 4 provided in Problem Statement section of Module 1. This module also has a Quiz section where there are some additional multiple choice Quiz Questions related to the Question you are addressing in this module.

## Module 6

6. Module 6 (Submit your Work and Grade Your Peers) - In this final Module you will submit your work that you have done for the previous 4 Modules. The work for every problem set  in the previous 4 Modules should be done in separate Jupyter notebooks. That is, you will need to submit the 4 notebooks - one notebook per each problem set. After submitting your notebooks , you also need to review/grade your Peer's work. Please go through the Submission Guideline and Peer Review Guideline in this Module carefully before starting submission and revie
